# **Holygon's Python Projects**

## **My Goals**

This is my repository for my projects using Python 3.  
I taught myself Python some years ago, but life got in the way, and I never really got proficient. This is my attempt at getting back into it.  
I plan on using this repository as a place to store my projects, and to use the `README.md` file as a tool to write project reports to gain an overview on my progess.  
The report structure should also serve as a method to quickly gain an overview of my thought process behind the creation of the program, to refer back to later.

*For all intents and purposes this repo is made for my private use and viewing, but if you are interested in observing the process of a novice learning the wonderful and scary world of programming, then feel free to read my reports.*

## **Report Structure Guidelines**

I want to structure my project reports in a rigid manner to effectivise the writing process, and to be able to have an easy way to look back on the thougt process behind each project.

*Guidelines*:

1. **Introduction** - What is the purpose of the program? What does the program do?
2. **Goals** - What are my goals for this project? (Learning, Functionality, Uses, etc.)
3. **Process** - How did I approach the goals? How did I come up with
4. **Execution** - How does the code work? What paths does it follow? (Maybe diagrams as visual aid?)
5. **Methods** - Which built-in functions did I use? Did I import libaries? Which?
6. **Hindsight** - Did I do something that in hindsight could've been done better? Any regrets? Any critisism?
7. **Conclusion** - Did I achieve my goals? How could I improve? Anything I need to remember for the next project?

## **Projects (ordered from oldest to newest)**

### **`dog.py` | Teach Arthur the Dog to sit... by giving him an excessive amount of treats**

#### **Introduction - What is the program**

The program **`dog.py`** is a "game" where you have to teach your dog, 'Arthur the Dog' to sit on command.
Arthur is a stubborn dog though, and refuses to even try to listen unless you give him the specific amount of treats he wants!  
Arthur is a very smart dog, and for some kind of reason he is capable of understanding the concept of numbers, and due to what either amounts to telepathy or the ability to speak, he can communicate the exact number of treats he wants to be satisfied...  
He will eat anything you give to him though, so be careful not to overfeed him, as he could get sick!

#### **Goals - What I set out to achieve with this program**

This is the first program I wrote after my hiatus. My goals for this project were:

* Regaining my knowledge of Python 3 syntax
* Getting into the algorithmic mindset again
* Creating a program with "game-y" mechanics, so the user is able to interact with it
* Creating failsafes for wrong user-input (ie. writing letters somewhere numbers are the expected input)
* Making the code readable
* Writing extensive comments to individual lines, to have somewhere to look up the methods I used for future projects
* Giving the program a "story element", so it would be easier to share with friends for contructive critisism and input.

I figured these goals would help me to understand the fundamentals of Python again, and give me a foundation for future projects.
I also wanted to make something fun, that I could share with people to regain my excitement for programming.

#### Process - How I came up with the idea

The concept of the dog training program came from the idea:

> How would I explain what programming is - and how it worked - to a child with no prior knowledge on the subject?  
> How would I make it interesting and easy to understand?

My answer to this was to explain the algorithmic process of making a dog understand what "sit" meant through the use of classical conditioning (ie. giving treats for obeying the command).  

Now I'm not in the business of making dog simulator games, so it became more of a process of a "how many treats does the dog want, before it will sit?".  
As the project went on, the *explaining to a child* idea became limiting, and I decided to abandon that, so I could delve into the more "advanced" built-in functions Python offer.
